Bernie Sanders 2016﻿ (d)(c+)

She is a follower not a leader, her own admission that she would release the transcripts if everyone else does it should make it obvious. Also should make it obvious that whatever is in there is something that will make anyone that doesn't know what a snake in the grass she is see it clear as day.﻿ (c-)

I don't think Hillary is being completely honest about her wall street connections... I just don't buy it﻿ (c-)
	I don't feel that way, and neither does the establishment. There is a reason Hillary has almost all the super-delegates. The democratic party is making a clear statement they will do the best they can to stop Bernie Sanders.﻿ (c+)

bernie >>>>>>>>>>> hilary﻿ (d)(c+)(c-)
	thank god you can actually think﻿ (d)(u+)

Bernie Sanders, is a very empathic individual, he's not going to attack people to win, rather he leads by example and teaches his political positions in a very sympathetic and truthful way.﻿ (d)(c+)
	Or just giving Hillary a green light to pass, democrat party is very clever not damaging their candidate's reputation﻿ (c-)
	That's not how politics work though. He looks weak in an extremely tough position. You think debating with fellow Americans is hard? Try taking on international negotiations with hostile parties. Young people like Bernie because he reflects the juvenile cucks that fill the universities.﻿ (c-)

Bernie wiped the floor with Corrupt Hillary﻿ (d)(c+)(c-)

1 hour 16 minutes in and $hillary tells us how important NATO is and how we need to find MORE MISSIONS to involve them in....like wars, regime changes, and other good business opportunities for her war mongering corporate interests.  #NeverHillary﻿ (c-)

Hillary Clinton is now talking like Donald trump. Speaking in circles. Fear mongering. And talking about how supposedly "great" she is. Hillary Clinton=bullshit.﻿ (c-)

#BERNIEORBUST #STILLSANDERS﻿ (d)(c+)

Hilary acts like a victim when it is transparent she's clearly heading in to aid the 1%. Her Wall Street plans are bs.﻿ (c-)

I hope I live to see the day when we do not have to watch Low Lifes like Hillary in debates. It is honestly painful to watch her. I honestly with all my heart can't imagine how anyone can watch her and not see the wickedness in her eyes, and posture. She is just a plain BAD PERSON. If she really cared about America or the World she would  remove her self from the running. Donald Trump is a no good dufus, but I suspect if given the choice of Hilary or Donald, many would vote for Donald simply because at least he may  have a heart behind his crazy orange persona. With Hilary we know exactly what we are getting, Lies, and War.  Personally no matter what the results of the Primary I am voting for Bernie.﻿ (d)(c+)(c-)
	Bernie: Says the truth Hillary: ....... 9/11!﻿ (d)(c+)(c-)

California, please don't vote for Hillary. PLEASE! Bernie is the only decent candidate any more . Hillary send classified emails through her social email account and when the government was investigated her she deleted 15K emails!!!!!! Plus 6 years ago she was against gay marriage, 40 years ago she was for racial segregation And she doesn't give a shiny shit about the people, she only cares about her legacy and big business! June 7th... Make the right decision for you, your kids and for the rest of the world!﻿ (d)(c-)(c+)

1:38:46 #FeelTheBern﻿ (d)(c+)

Hillary is a cunt﻿ (c-)

I love this man! #berniesanders2016 #feelthebern﻿ (d)(c+)

Sucks seeing Bernie lose to Hillary when he's worked so hard to bring forth actual change.﻿ (d)(c+)

Screw Hillary. You Americans who cheer her have some serious reality issues. She is in the same exact boat as Hussein Obama,  "Find more missions". As a European, who is quite involved in major European social websites, I can tell you all one thing for sure, Europeans are getting increasingly fed up with America's politicians. After 9/11 when the US government cowardly invoked the NATO article to help us "clean" or should I say, worsen their mess caused by personal interests they left us with an immigration crisis out of this world. Europe as a continent lies right above Africa and next to the middle east, they come to us in boats daily, thousands upon. There have been confirmed ISIS soldiers in some countries in Europe. This is all thanks to the policy that thing, Clinton is standing for. USA denies most of the "refugees" dumping them on us. If she is elected President, civilian Americans will have a HARD time in Europe.﻿ (c-)

These two are so crooked.﻿ (c-)

Killary is a sociopath.﻿ (c-)

Hillary is fake. How can america not see this?﻿ (c-)(u-)

i feel that people only vote for Hillary due to her being a good speaker, but dont realize how inaccurate and flawed everything she talks about, and she never even gives an answer she just changes the subject about her and obama﻿ (c-)(u-)

All of Hillary's supporters are so damn stupid. They're yelling and hollering, cheering at the simplest of statements and promises that won't be followed through with. Very, very sad.﻿ (c-)(u-)

shillary lies so often, she doesn't even know when she's lying. gun manufacturers getting "special protection" from being sued from making legal sales? wait, did we start allowing victims of DUI accidents to sue car makers?﻿ (c-)
	lmao so true﻿ (u+)

"If somebody offers you something for free, read the fine print" - says Hillary Clinton about education and healthcare which should be a basic human right by now. People like her who call rights freebies will never bring about real progress.﻿ (c-)
	it's not a right to force somebody to pay for your healthcare...﻿ (u-)

Uses 9/11 as a pivoting point in her campaign in her opening statement...﻿ (c-)
	I know right? She always does that. Reminds me of Family Guy when Lois ran for mayor.﻿ (u+)

He's so for the people that he won't even call it 'his' campaign. He calls it 'ours'. Because his campaign is our campaign.﻿ (d)(c+)

The Democratic clown show Crazy Bernie Lying Hillary (c-)

if either of them were elected wed be fucked﻿ (c-)

America.. While Bernie is the better man, Hillary is leading the polls by a landslide, I know Bernie supporters are Die Hard and "Bern or Bust" but we all need to get behind Hillary CLinton and vote for her, or else we may have a racist, homophobic, arrogant , blowhard, idiot , ego, pompous clown in the White House.﻿ (d)(c+)
	 So is Hillary (u-)(c-)
	 You do know only one runs in the general election right?﻿ (u-)

Hillary attacks the NRA for having an influence on gun control, but any donations or relations she has aren't applicable to the same level of control. Only if Bernie had the back bone to call her out, oh well... Trump 2016﻿ (r)(c-)

Hillary would ruin this country and bernies numbers don't add up. Trump, Cruz or Kasich would be 100 times better than either of these jokers. Socialism doesn't work. E.g. Venezuela, ussr, Greece China, Cuba, Vietnam, n. Korea, Laos, Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Benin,Bulgaria, Congo, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Mozambique, Poland, Romania, Somalia, Yemen, Yugoslavia.﻿ (r)(c-)(c+)
	Cruz and Kasich? I'm laughing my ass off that you even included those two. Trump or Sanders are the real anti-establishment candidates.﻿ (u-)
	anti establishment sure. Kasich is smart. I'm not a big fan of Cruz though﻿ (u+)(c-)(c+)

They're both retarded.﻿ (c-)

fuck hilbilly lol﻿ (c-)

Bernie seemed a bit flustered here, whilst Hillary came across more composed and presidential.﻿ (c+)(c-)
	and full of shit﻿ (u-)(c-)
	true﻿ (u+)
	That just means she's practiced telling her lies in the mirror, and that Bernie is afraid to tell the truth in the off chance the special interests decide to assassinate him for exposing them.﻿ (u-)(c-)
	You know you also comes off as cool calm and collected? Sociopaths... Hillery is all smoke and mirrors, thats why she comes off the way she does.﻿ (u-)(c-)

Hillary talks like Trump in a way just talking no points﻿ (c-)

yay....2 socialists arguing over who the biggest socialist is.﻿ (c-)
	 hi redneck﻿ (u-)
	 Philboy50....?﻿ Redneck is an interesting choice of words....inaccurate, but interesting. ﻿(u-)
	 as opposed to 2 bigots arguing over who the biggest bigot is?﻿ (u-)
	 Bigotry is intolerance of another's beliefs and, believe it or not, you can have opposition without intolerance. That's why our government was originally set up the way it was. Multiple opposing branches keeping each other in check. I have views that don't align with Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, however that doesn't make me a bigot, I just have opposing views. It would seem you don't agree with me so does that make you a bigot?﻿ (u-)
	 ​....I'm not calling you a bigot. I am just following your line of reasoning to its logical end. Personally, I think alot of words are thrown around with very little regard to their meaning, thus causing alot of ruckus where none was needed.﻿
	 Democratic socialism is different from Socialism maybe research should be your friend..﻿ (u-)
	 Thank you +Connor Rilling​. I didn't think of that.﻿ (u+)

How is possible people vote for Hilary??? So dumb people...﻿ (c-)(u-)
	Because she actually has policies and knows what the fuck shes talking about﻿ (u-)(c+)
	LMAO what are u smoking﻿ (u-)
	she will fuck this country up﻿ (c-)
	She has tons of experience and knowledge that Bernie is lacking. She also has detailed plans about how to achieve her goals. Whereas Bernie is all slogan, no substance.﻿ (u-)(c+)(c-)
	Hers is funded by other interests. So how can you even call her detailed plans hers?﻿ (u-)(c-)
	Benghazi sure is experience lmao..how about the money laundering and tax evasion thru Clinton Foundation﻿ (u-)
	Cool She will be Obama 2, bet you bought his koolaid... Better off with Trump.﻿ (u-)(r)(c+)
